# Tic-Tac-Toe v.2
Basic command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game; improved version over my original [TicTacToe](https://github.com/globewalldesk/tictactoe), with refactoring and made in OOP style.

## Motivation

Just a programming exercise, converting a procedural script into a (more complicated, but more maintainable?) OOP project.

## How to install and running

The program to run is ```ttt2.rb```. To install, simply download the whole package (not just that file) to a folder. Ruby must be installed, as must the Ruby gem [colorize](https://github.com/fazibear/colorize "Download 'colorize' here"). Once these are installed, navigate via the command line to the directory where ```ttt2.rb``` lives, and type ```ruby ttt2.rb``` to run.

## Tests

No tests yet. Shame on me!
